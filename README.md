# VR Medical Training - Room of Horror
The patient safety “Room of Horror” is an interactive VR simulation that aims to help interprofessional learners including nursing, pharmacy, and medical students identify the potential hazards in a hospital room. Trainees navigate using a unity-based environment using immersive headset technology and interact with objects to identify patient safety errors and answer embedded questions related to patient safety.  They earn points for identifying errors and correct responses yielding a summative score. In addition to safety hazards, trainees can learn to communicate with patients, as well as the families of patients through high-fidelity 3D characters and animations. The scripts are based on a real-life scenario.
